# auroraos

(from 2021)

auroraos is a desktop environment in your browser. I made this back in 2021 to practice my coding skills.

This demonstrates my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript in a web environment, as well as some Node.js on the server-side for authentication and the virtual file system - though it is from 2021, so my skills have improved since then.

It uses vanilla JS only with some jQuery. If I were to rewrite it, I would probably use React or some other library.
